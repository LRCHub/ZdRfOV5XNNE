[00:05.78] Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
[00:09.20] Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
[00:12.69] Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
[00:16.16] Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
[00:19.44] Turn me back like woah-uh-woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh

[00:33.34] Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushin' that Monte Carlo?
[00:37.50] Bet that money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh, no
[00:40.56] See them, he wears in the desert, look like a lake in the sand
[00:44.29] Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
[00:48.97] You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
[00:52.69] Better man, what you made me, made me aware what I was missin'
[00:57.44] Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
[01:01.00] Never thought I'd settle down, I can not lie to myself
[01:05.31] I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
[01:08.39] Set my feelings to the side they all got dusty on the shelf
[01:12.02] You wiped them down when I had nothin' left
[01:33.52] 
[01:14.32] Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?

[01:33.12] Woah-uh-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
[01:38.22] Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
[02:00.22] 
[01:41.85] When you asked me if I cheated, I said never (No way)
[01:45.12] What are you willing to do to stay together ('Gether)
[01:48.36] How many times we gonna break up 'fore the summer?
[01:51.70] How many times you gonna try to call my mother? (Brr)
[01:55.49] Girl, you're killin' me
[01:56.85] I don't wanna act like I can fix this (Fix it)
[02:00.38] I don't wanna be the one that's changed since Texas
[02:04.09] Currency, it comes so naturally, but I can't buy your love
[02:33.09] 
[02:09.25] Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
[02:12.64] Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
[02:16.04] Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
[02:19.45] Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around

[02:27.69] Woah-uh-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
[02:33.14] Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
[02:55.14] 
[02:36.32] I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
[02:39.98] Wake up, your face in my chest, your favorite hiding place
[02:43.32] The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
[02:46.72] Countin' the stars with our last name on the license plate
[02:50.34] Whoa, oh, oh, oh
[02:51.46] I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone
[02:54.67] When I leave, it's bye for now, it's just never bye for long
[02:58.19] Set my feelings aside, let's settle down
[03:00.88] Everytime I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
[03:27.38] 
[03:04.12] Turn me back like woah-uh-woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
[03:09.02] Woah-uh-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
[03:14.58] Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
[03:17.68] Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
[03:21.00] Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
[03:24.60] Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
[03:28.06] Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
