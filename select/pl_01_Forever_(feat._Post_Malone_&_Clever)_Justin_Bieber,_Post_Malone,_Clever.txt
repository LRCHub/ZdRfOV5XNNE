Could you be here with me
forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me
forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't
better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way
you turn me back around
Turn me back like whoa,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever,
ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever,
ever, ever?
Yeah, do you see us in Vegas
pushing a Monte Carlo
Bet the money on baby,
bet she don't leave me, oh no
See them heat waves
in the desert look like a lake
in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out
with me forever,
ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me
Keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me
Made me aware of
what I was missing
Been missing the way
you gave me ambition, babe
Never thought I'd settle down
Reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusing
on being by myself
Set my feelings to the side they
all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down
when I had nothing left
Could you be here with me
forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me
forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't
better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way
you turn me back around
Turn me back like whoa,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever,
ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever,
ever, ever?
When you asked me if I cheated,
I said never
What are you willing to do
to stay together?
How many times we gonna break up
for the summer?
How many times you gonna try
to call my mother?
Girl, you killin' me
I don't wanna act like
I can fix this
I don't wanna be the one
that's changed since Texas
Currency, it comes so naturally
But I can't buy your love
Could you be here with me
forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me
forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't
better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way
you turn me back around
Turn me back like whoa,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever,
ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever,
ever, ever?
I promise I'm gonna love you
till my dying day
Wake up, your face in my chest
Your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone
as we're driving
out the private gate
Counting the stars
with our last name
on the license plate
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I lied to myself 'bout trying
to be here all alone
When I leave, it's bye for now,
it's just never bye for long
Set my feeling aside
Let's settle down
Every time I go the wrong way
you turn me back around
Turn me back like whoa,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever,
ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever,
ever, ever?
Won't you be here with me
forever, ever, ever?
Won't you be here with me
forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't
better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way
you turn me back around
