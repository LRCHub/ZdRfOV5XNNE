Love forever
And one love alone
A now and forever with you

Now and forever, as sure as the snow
As long as the ocean roars
Ill love you in a way that Ill never begin to outgrow
Ill now and forever be yours

From this blessed day, all this whole life through
Starting when we say I do
Forever and ever and ever

Now and forever, just one humble stone
But oh, what a stone can do
It means that I have one love forever
And one love alone
A now and forever with you

From this blessed day, all this whole life through
Starting when we say I do
Forever and ever and ever

Now and forever, as sure as the snow
As long as the oceans blue
Ill love you in a way that Ill never begin to outgrow
Ill now and forever and ever and ever
And ever and ever and ever
Now and forever
